    The photos required will vary by brand and we will ask for specific photos if what we need is not shown. 
    <br />
    Please ensure that photos are taken in natural light, no flash, at a straight on angle.  
    <br />
    In the case of engravings and wording, a macro setting on your camera will give us the best results.
    <br />
    Every effort is made to provide you with quick turn around service.  
    <br />
    However, that is not always possible if photos are not submitted properly.  
    <br />
    With this in mind, here is a list of DONT'S! Any of these WILL result in the delay of your authentication.
    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>DONT'S</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Submit blurry or out of focus photos. High resolution, in focus, photos are required.</li>
        <li>Submit photos that are too small.  They should be at least 2 MB or larger.</li>
        <li>Submit collages, PDF's or screen shots.</li>
        <li>Use flash unless absolutely necessary. It distorts colors, and washes out the view.</li>
        <li>Take photos from angles. Everything needs to be straight on, otherwise, it becomes distorted.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>DO'S</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Send individual large, in focus, high resolution photos.</li>
        <li>Use a standard camera to take photos.  It does not have to be a professional camera. A point and shoot with a macro setting is sufficient.</li>
        <li>Provide multiple photos of the markings, just to be sure we receive usable quality photos.</li>
        <li>Take all photos in natural lighting at straight on angles. </li>
        <li>Make sure your photos are facing right side up. Not sideways or upside down.</li>
    </ul>
