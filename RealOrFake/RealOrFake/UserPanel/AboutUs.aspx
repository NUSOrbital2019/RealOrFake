    <h4>Background Information</h4>
    RealOrFake started out as a labor of love. 
    <br />
    We are a collaborated group of people tired of seeing buyers ripped off and target sites such as eBay and Carousell to get their fakes removed. 
    <br />
    We are behind the scenes protecting consumers who do not even know we exist. 
    <br />
    In the meantime, we realize this is a valuable service and would like to help consumers with pre-purchase authentications, as well as offer post-purchase authentications if you suspect you bought a fake, or just need peace of mind. 
    <br />
    All of our associates are 100% against fakes because of their ties to child labor, terrorism, human trafficking, drugs, murder and violent crimes. 
    <br />
    Not to mention they are highly illegal. 
    <br />
    We strive to offer you the very best service and will continue to be there for you should you need to file a claim. 
    <br />
    <br />

    RealOrFake's authenticators have bought, sold and studied brands like Louis Vuitton for many years. 
    <br />
    We have authenticators worldwide who can help you, regardless of what country you are in. 
    <br />
    We are here to protect you from being ripped off by con artists who want nothing more than to steal your money and leave you holding a fake. 
    <br />
    We have seen firsthand thousands of auctions and websites charging hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for a fake. 
    <br />
    Although efforts have been made by sites such as eBay for post-auction problems, it is still a stressful time for you if you buy a fake. 
    <br />
    Some sites offer no help and leave you hanging, not to mention your money is tied up until it is all settled. 
    <br />
    <br />

    RealOrFake can also help you with verification paperwork should you need to file a claim with your credit card company or a website. 
    <br />
    If at all possible, always authenticate with RealOrFake first before you buy. 
    <br />
    We are highly experienced and able to know if a product is counterfeit easily.

    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
    Our mission is to provide personal authentication services and to help answer authenticity questions for handbags, wallets, and other accessories. 
    <br />
    We strive for the best customer service and offer our clients the most skilled authenticators in the business.
